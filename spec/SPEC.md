# TWFF Specification

**Version:** 0.1.0
**Status:** Draft

**Authors:** Functional Intelligence Research Lab (FIRL)
**License:** Apache-2.0 (see [LICENSE](./LICENSE))

## Abstract

The Tracked Writing File Format (TWFF) is an open container format for packaging a written document alongside a deterministic audit trail of its composition process. TWFF enables *Verifiable Effort*: a cryptographic record that an author can voluntarily disclose to verify the authenticity of their work without relying on probabilistic AI detection systems.

---

## Status of This Document

This document is a **Draft Specification**.

The schema and event types defined here constitute the normative v0.1 release. Breaking changes will be issued under a new version number. Non-breaking additions (new optional fields, new event types) may be added with a minor version increment.

Feedback and proposals: open an issue at [github.com/Functional-Intelligence-Research-Lab/twff](https://github.com/Functional-Intelligence-Research-Lab/twff)

## 1. Motivation

### 1.1 The Detection Failure

AI content detectors operate on a fundamental statistical premise: given a body of text, estimate the probability that it was generated by a language model rather than a human author. This architecture has three structural problems.

**It is biased.** Research presented at NeurIPS 2023 demonstrates that detection models systematically misclassify writing by non-native English speakers as AI-generated at significantly higher rates than native speakers. Stanford analysis confirmed false positive rates of 61% on TOEFL essay samples. Linguistic diversity is treated as statistical anomaly.

**It is not auditable.** Every major commercial detector operates on proprietary algorithms. No student has ever received a meaningful technical explanation of a false positive. The vendor produces a score; the institution acts on it; the student bears the consequence. There is no appeal path grounded in evidence.

**It is not solvable.** Detection accuracy is bounded by the distributional shift between training data and deployment data. As language models evolve and prompting techniques advance, the gap between what detectors claim and what they deliver widens toward infinity. This is a mathematical constraint, not an engineering problem.

### 1.2 The Proposed Shift

TWFF reframes the question.

- **Wrong question:** *Can we estimate the probability that this text was machine-generated?*
- **Right question:** *Can we preserve and verify the record of how this text was produced?*

The first approach produces confidence intervals, false positives, and adversarial relationships. The second produces a deterministic, cryptographically-verifiable record of human effort.

### 1.3 Legal Context

The EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689), in force from August 2024, establishes binding transparency requirements for AI systems used in high-risk contexts including education. Article 50 requires machine-readable labelling of AI-generated content. Articles 52 and Recital 72 require that such systems be explainable and subject to human oversight.

AI detectors satisfy none of these requirements. TWFF is designed to satisfy all of them.

## 2. Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Container** | A `.twff` file; a ZIP archive conforming to this specification |
| **Process Log** | The `meta/process-log.json` file recording composition events |
| **Session** | A bounded writing period, delimited by `session_start` and `session_end` events |
| **Verifiable Effort** | A disclosure that allows a third party to independently verify the composition process |
| **Author** | The human writer whose process is being recorded |
| **Implementer** | Any software system producing or consuming TWFF containers |

---

## 3. Container Format

### 3.1 File Extension and MIME Type

- File extension: `.twff`
- MIME type: `application/vnd.twff+zip` (pending IANA registration)

### 3.2 ZIP Structure

A TWFF container is a valid ZIP archive (ZIP64 MAY be used for large containers). The archive MUST contain the following structure:

```
document.twff  (ZIP archive)
├── content/
│   ├── document.xhtml           REQUIRED — primary written work
│   ├── images/                  OPTIONAL — embedded images
│   └── assets/                  OPTIONAL — supporting files (bibliography, etc.)
├── meta/
│   ├── process-log.json         REQUIRED — composition event log
│   ├── manifest.xml             RECOMMENDED — container manifest
│   └── chat-transcript.json     OPTIONAL — full AI conversation history
└── META-INF/
    └── signatures.xml           OPTIONAL — cryptographic signatures
```

### 3.3 Content Format

The primary content file (`content/document.xhtml`) MUST be valid XHTML 1.1 or XHTML5. XHTML is required because:

- It is XML-based and strictly parseable, enabling reliable position mapping
- It supports `<span data-*>` attributes for annotation embedding
- It is transformable to PDF, DOCX, and HTML without loss
- It is human-readable

Implementers MAY include additional content files (plain text, LaTeX source) under `content/` as supplementary materials.

### 3.4 Manifest

If present, `meta/manifest.xml` MUST list all files in the container with their media types, following the EPUB package.opf convention:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest>
  <item id="content" href="content/document.xhtml" media-type="application/xhtml+xml"/>
  <item id="log"     href="meta/process-log.json"  media-type="application/json"/>
  <item id="chat"    href="meta/chat-transcript.json" media-type="application/json"/>
</manifest>
```

## 5. Integrity

### 5.1 Hash Chain (v0.1)

Implementers SHOULD include a `_integrity` block in `process-log.json`:

```json
"_integrity": {
  "algorithm": "SHA-256",
  "salt": "session_id",
  "hash": "<hex-encoded SHA-256 of JSON(events) + session_id>",
  "note": "Hash of the events array as compact JSON, concatenated with session_id."
}
```

The hash is computed as:

```text
SHA-256( JSON.stringify(events, {sort_keys: true}) + session_id )
```

This allows any verifier to detect post-hoc modification of the event log.

### 5.2 Digital Signatures (Future — v1.5)

Future versions will support RSA detached signatures in `META-INF/signatures.xml`, enabling public-key verification of the process log.

---

## 6. Privacy Requirements

### 6.1 What MUST NOT be stored

- Individual keystroke content (only aggregated character counts and positions)
- Raw prompts or full AI responses (only metadata previews, MUST be truncated to ≤100 characters)
- Personally identifiable information beyond the `user_id`
- Screen recordings, mouse movements, or biometric data

### 6.2 `user_id` Requirements

- MUST be anonymous and contain no PII
- SHOULD be generated locally by the author (not assigned by a server)
- SHOULD be rotatable between sessions
- MUST NOT be tied to any account, email address, or device identifier

### 6.3 Data Sovereignty

Implementers MUST generate and store all TWFF data locally on the author's machine by default. No telemetry MUST be transmitted to any third-party server without explicit, informed author consent.

---

## 7. Visualisation

Implementations MAY provide visualisation of the composition process by:

1. Parsing the XHTML content into a DOM tree
2. For each event with `position_start` and `position_end`, locating the corresponding text range
3. Wrapping the range in a `<span>` with appropriate `class` and `data-tooltip` attributes
4. Rendering the annotated document with a legend

Reference CSS classes (used in Glass Box):

| Annotation | CSS Class | Colour |
|---|---|---|
| AI paraphrase | `ann-paraphrase` | Blue tint (`#3b82f6`) |
| AI generated | `ann-generated` | Green tint (`#10b981`) |
| External paste | `ann-external` | Amber tint (`#f59e0b`) |
| AI completion | `ann-completion` | Violet tint (`#8b5cf6`) |

---

## 8. Conformance

A **conformant producer** MUST:
- Generate a valid ZIP archive with the required directory structure
- Include `content/document.xhtml` as valid XHTML
- Include `meta/process-log.json` conforming to the schema in §4
- Record all AI interactions occurring during the session
- Not store prohibited data (§6.1)
- Generate a `user_id` that satisfies §6.2

A **conformant consumer** MUST:
- Accept any container produced by a conformant producer
- Validate `process-log.json` against the schema before processing
- Verify the `_integrity` hash if present and report any mismatch
